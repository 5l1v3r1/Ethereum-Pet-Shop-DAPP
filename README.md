There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following:

* Node.js v6+ LTS and npm (comes with Node)
* Git

Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:

```
npm install -g truffle

```

take a look at this tut for now: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop

in one terminal:
```
truffle develop

```
npm run dev
```
